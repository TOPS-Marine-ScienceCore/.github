# Marine ScienceCore Team

This organization is for the developer team.  Please check out the public site:

**[ScienceCore: Marine Sciences](https://sciencecore-marine-sciences.github.io)**


## What we're working on

Using existing research products as a starting point, we will develop:
- An open-source computational component to a marine sciences lab
- Online, interactive tutorials that lower the learning curve for using satellite data
- A recipe for transforming a traditional workflow into an open one

## Open-Source Science

From NASA'S Open-Source Science Initiative ([OSSI](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science-overview)):
> Open-source science requires a culture shift to a more inclusive, transparent, and collaborative scientific process, which will increase the pace and quality of scientific progress.

As part of the OSSI, course materials are being developed for [Open Science 101](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/open-science-101), also called **OpenCore**.  Beyond the basics, it is often difficult
to find the time or motivation to study something not specifically applicable to our current workloads.  Enter **ScienceCore**: 
> ScienceCore is a curriculum of discipline-specific materials that showcase open-science workflows.


## NASA's Transform to Open Science

This effort is funded by NASA's [Transform to Open Science](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science) Training (TOPST) program under award 80NSSC23K0863 to North Carolina State University with University of South Alabama.

See the [Proposal Summary](proposal-summary.md) for more details.
