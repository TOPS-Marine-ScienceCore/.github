# ScienceCore for Marine Sciences

Tutorials on data collection, analysis methods, and visualization techniques used in physical oceanography and biogeochemistry by retracing the steps needed to reproduce results from two published articles([1,2](https://github.com/TOPS-Marine-ScienceCore/.github/blob/main/README.md#references)).
1. Combining field data with satellite data to understand the sea surface temperature conditions associated with a hurricane undergoing rapid intensification over the continental shelf
2. Using locally calibrated satellite products to improve the satellite estimation of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in coastal waters

This effort is funded by NASA's [Transform to Open Science](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science) Training (TOPST) program under award 80NSSC23K0863 to North Carolina State University with University of South Alabama.
